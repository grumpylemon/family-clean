# Push Notifications System - Feature Deep Dive

## 1.1 Feature Goal

The Push Notifications System provides real-time engagement and awareness for the Chore Takeover System:

### User-visible Value:
- **Proactive Alerts**: Instant notifications when chores become takeover-eligible
- **Achievement Celebrations**: Push notifications for Helper Hero milestones
- **Admin Workflow**: Immediate alerts for high-value takeover requests needing approval
- **Family Coordination**: Keep everyone informed of takeover activities in real-time
- **Engagement Boost**: Timely nudges increase family participation and response rates

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### Notification Types & Rules
1. **Chore Takeover Eligible**:
   - Trigger: Chore becomes overdue (24+ hours)
   - Recipients: All active family members except original assignee
   - Frequency: Once per chore, with 6-hour reminders if not taken
   - Content: "Kitchen cleaning is available for takeover (+5 bonus points!)"

2. **Helper Hero Achievement**:
   - Trigger: User reaches 10 takeovers milestone
   - Recipients: Achieving user + family admins
   - Frequency: Once per achievement
   - Content: "ðŸ¦¸ Sarah unlocked Helper Hero! 10 chores taken over!"

3. **Admin Approval Required**:
   - Trigger: High-value chore takeover (100+ points)
   - Recipients: Family admins only
   - Frequency: Immediate + 2-hour reminder if not approved
   - Content: "Takeover approval needed: Deep clean garage (150 pts)"

4. **Takeover Completed**:
   - Trigger: Taken-over chore is completed
   - Recipients: Original assignee + family admins
   - Content: "John completed your kitchen cleaning (+20 XP bonus!)"

5. **Daily Helper Summary**:
   - Trigger: End of day if takeovers occurred
   - Recipients: All family members
   - Content: "Today's helpers: Sarah (2), Mike (1). Great teamwork!"

### Permission & Filtering Rules
- Users can disable specific notification types in settings
- Quiet hours: No notifications between 9 PM - 7 AM (user timezone)
- Smart grouping: Bundle multiple similar notifications
- Priority levels: Achievement > Admin > Takeover > Summary

### Edge Cases
- Offline users: Queue notifications for delivery when online
- Deleted chores: Cancel pending notifications
- Family removal: Immediately revoke all notification permissions
- Mock mode: Show in-app notifications instead of system push

## 1.3 Ripple Map

### New Files to Create
1. **Notification Service** (`services/`):
   - `notificationService.ts` - Core notification logic
   - `pushNotificationConfig.ts` - Expo notifications setup
   - `notificationTemplates.ts` - Message templates and formatting

2. **Cloud Functions** (`functions/src/`):
   - `triggers/takeoverNotifications.ts` - Firestore trigger functions
   - `scheduled/dailySummaryNotifications.ts` - Daily summary job
   - `utils/notificationUtils.ts` - Helper functions

3. **Components** (`components/`):
   - `NotificationSettings.tsx` - User preference controls
   - `NotificationPermissionRequest.tsx` - Permission prompt
   - `InAppNotificationBanner.tsx` - Fallback for mock mode

4. **Hooks** (`hooks/`):
   - `useNotifications.ts` - Notification state management
   - `usePushPermissions.ts` - Permission handling

### Files to Modify
1. **Settings Screen** (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`):
   - Add notification preferences section
   - Toggle controls for each notification type

2. **Family Store** (`stores/familyStore.ts`):
   - Add notification preferences to user state
   - Track notification permissions

3. **App Layout** (`app/_layout.tsx`):
   - Initialize notification service
   - Handle notification taps and routing

4. **Takeover Sync Service** (`services/takeoverSyncService.ts`):
   - Trigger notifications on successful takeovers
   - Queue achievement notifications

5. **Types** (`types/index.ts`):
   - Add notification interfaces and settings

### External Dependencies
- **Expo Notifications**: For cross-platform push notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Backend notification delivery
- **Firestore Triggers**: Real-time notification triggers

## 1.4 UX & Engagement Uplift

### Immediate Value
1. **Reduced Response Time**: 
   - Average takeover response time drops from 6+ hours to 2 hours
   - Family members learn about overdue chores instantly

2. **Achievement Recognition**:
   - Helper Hero celebrations increase motivation
   - Public recognition encourages continued helping behavior

3. **Admin Efficiency**:
   - High-value takeover approvals processed in minutes vs hours
   - Clear action items with one-tap approval

### Behavioral Changes
1. **Proactive Helping**:
   - Notifications create FOMO around helping opportunities
   - Gamified alerts make takeovers feel rewarding

2. **Family Awareness**:
   - Everyone sees who's helping and when
   - Builds culture of mutual support and appreciation

3. **Admin Oversight**:
   - Real-time visibility into family collaboration
   - Quick intervention when approval needed

### Engagement Metrics
- **Notification CTR**: Target 60%+ click-through rate
- **Takeover Response Time**: Target 50% improvement
- **Helper Participation**: Target 25% more unique helpers monthly

## 1.5 Data Model Deltas
