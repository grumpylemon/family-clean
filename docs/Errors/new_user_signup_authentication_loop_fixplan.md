# New User Sign-Up Authentication Loop - Fix Plan

**Date**: May 31, 2025  
**Error Type**: Authentication Flow / User Registration Issue  
**Status**: In Progress  

## 1.0 The Error

**Issue**: New users who successfully complete Google authentication are immediately bounced back to the Google or Guest Login page instead of proceeding to the family setup flow.

**Specific Examples**:
- User clicks "Sign in with Google" on login screen
- Google authentication completes successfully (OAuth flow works)
- Firebase Authentication is successful (user appears in Firebase Auth console)
- User is immediately redirected back to login screen instead of family setup
- Subsequent login attempts continue the loop

**Console Evidence from Build v2.175**:
```
[AuthSlice] Checking for redirect authentication result...
[AuthSlice] Setting up new auth state listener
authService.onAuthStateChanged called
Using real Firebase onAuthStateChanged
LOGIN SCREEN DEBUG:
  Platform: web
  Mock: false
  User: No user
  Loading: false
```

**Root Cause**: Authentication flow successfully authenticates users with Firebase, but there's a logic gap in the post-authentication flow that determines whether a user should see the login screen vs. family setup screen for new users.

## 1.1 Issues it Causes

**User Registration Failures**:
- New users cannot complete registration process
- Google OAuth flow appears broken to users
- Users may attempt multiple sign-ins thinking it's a temporary error
- Prevents family creation and app onboarding

**User Experience Issues**:
- Confusing authentication loop creates poor first impression
- Users may abandon app thinking authentication is broken
- No clear feedback about what went wrong
- Legitimate authentication appears to fail

**Functional Restrictions**:
- New users cannot create families
- New users cannot join existing families
- App cannot acquire new users through registration
- Demo/Guest mode becomes the only working entry point

**Business Impact**:
- User acquisition completely blocked for Google sign-in
- App growth severely limited to guest users only
- User retention affected by broken onboarding experience
- Potential negative reviews about authentication issues

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

**Authentication Flow Logic**:
1. **Login Screen**: Shows Google/Guest buttons when no authenticated user
2. **Google OAuth**: Handles redirect to Google and token exchange
3. **Firebase Auth**: Creates/authenticates user with Firebase
4. **User Profile Check**: Determines if user exists in Firestore users collection
5. **Family Association Check**: Determines if user has familyId
6. **Navigation Decision**: Routes to login/family-setup/dashboard based on user state

**Edge Cases & Conditions**:
- **New User**: No user profile in Firestore, no familyId
- **Returning User with Family**: User profile exists, has familyId
- **Returning User without Family**: User profile exists, no familyId
- **Firebase Auth Success + Firestore Failure**: User authenticated but profile creation fails
- **Network Issues**: Authentication succeeds but family data fetch fails
- **Guest to Google Conversion**: Guest user later signs in with Google

**Permission Checks**:
- Firebase Authentication permissions (OAuth scopes)
- Firestore read/write permissions for users collection
- Family membership validation permissions
- Admin role permission assignment

**Compatibility Issues**:
- Browser CORS policies affecting popup authentication
- OAuth redirect URL configuration in Firebase Console
- Cache persistence affecting user state detection
- Multiple tab synchronization with auth state changes

**Cooldowns & Timing**:
- Firebase Auth state change propagation delays
- Zustand store persistence hydration timing
- Family data fetch async loading
- Navigation redirect timing conflicts
