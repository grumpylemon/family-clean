🎯 Recommended Next Steps

  Based on the current state of the app and logical progression, here are the most
  strategic next steps:

  Immediate Priority (High Impact, Low Effort):



  Medium Priority (Core Gamification):

  3. 🎖️ Achievements UI/Gallery
    - Why: Achievement logic exists but users can't see their progress
    - Tasks: Achievement gallery, progress indicators, notification system
    - Impact: Visual feedback for accomplishments
  4. 📈 Leaderboards
    - Why: Family competition drives engagement
    - Tasks: Weekly champions, all-time leaders, streak leaderboards
    - Impact: Social motivation and family engagement
  5. 💰 Money System Toggle
    - Why: Some families prefer real money rewards
    - Tasks: Admin toggle, monetary values for chores, balance tracking
    - Impact: Flexibility for different family reward systems

  

  Recommended Starting Point:

  Start with the Reward System because:
  - It directly builds on the working points system
  - It provides immediate user value
  - It completes the core gamification loop
  - It's a logical prerequisite for more advanced features
