  @docs/development_task_list.md  line 264. Think about it first and make a plan,
   then code it, then review, test, check. Once done update the 
  @docs/development_task_list.md document with the new integrations and changes 
  that got finished. Take your time, this is important.
  


Run the script I just created:

  2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
  3. In the Console, run:
  localStorage.clear(); location.reload();
