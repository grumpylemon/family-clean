🎯 Recommended Next Steps

  Based on the current state of the app and logical progression, here are the most
  strategic next steps:

  Immediate Priority (High Impact, Low Effort):

  1. 🏆 Reward System Implementation
    - Why: Points are now working, so users need something to spend them on

  redemption flow
    - Impact: Completes the gamification loop (earn points → spend points)
  2. 📊 Weekly Points Tracking & Visualization
    - Why: Users can see points but need progression tracking
    - Tasks: 7-day rolling window calculation, weekly progress bars, reset mechanism
    - Impact: Adds competitive element and goal-setting

  Medium Priority (Core Gamification):

  3. 🎖️ Achievements UI/Gallery
    - Why: Achievement logic exists but users can't see their progress
    - Tasks: Achievement gallery, progress indicators, notification system
    - Impact: Visual feedback for accomplishments
  4. 📈 Leaderboards
    - Why: Family competition drives engagement
    - Tasks: Weekly champions, all-time leaders, streak leaderboards
    - Impact: Social motivation and family engagement
  5. 💰 Money System Toggle
    - Why: Some families prefer real money rewards
    - Tasks: Admin toggle, monetary values for chores, balance tracking
    - Impact: Flexibility for different family reward systems

  Technical Foundation:

  6. 🔧 UI/UX Enhancements
