## 2 Implementation / Coding

Follow this disciplined cycle **for each logical chunk** (commit):

1. **Plan snippet** (1–2 lines)  
2. **Code diff** (new/updated files)  
3. **Immediate unit tests** (Jest)  
4. **Run static checks**  

## 3 Document Updates
1. Append a dated changelog entry under “Integrated Features” in @docs/Coding/development_task_list.md and mark any new integration checked off. If integration or features are not in document yet, add them and check-off.
2. Add future update or expansion ideas within the same section into @docs/Coding/development_task_list.md
2. Update any affected ADRs, README snippets, or API docs

## 4 Updates
1. Push to Git with Detailed description
2. Build and Deploy new version to web server and hosting
3. Run Webserver and check for any errors

## 5 Recommend next steps to user
1.Based on the updated @@docs/development_task_list.md doc, propose list of 1-5 next improvements to takle prioritised by user impact, technical risk, or debt reduction.
