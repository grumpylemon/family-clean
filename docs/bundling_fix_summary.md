# Bundling Fix Summary - "TypeError: G is not a function"

## Problem
The deployed web app was throwing "TypeError: G is not a function" at line 5937 in the bundle. The error occurred in the useAuth hook where `checkAuthState` (minified as G) was being called.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Module ordering problems in the webpack bundle
2. Circular dependencies between store modules
3. React being referenced before it was properly loaded in the bundle

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed React Import in useAuthZustand.ts
Changed from destructured import to default import:
```typescript
// Before
import { useEffect } from 'react';

// After
import React from 'react';
// Then use React.useEffect
```

### 2. Removed Circular Dependencies
Fixed circular import issues in the stores:

**networkService.ts**:
- Removed direct import of `useFamilyStore`
- Added lazy loading via `require()` in a helper method
```typescript
private getStore() {
  const { useFamilyStore } = require('./familyStore');
  return useFamilyStore.getState();
}
```

**enhancedSyncService.ts**:
- Applied the same pattern to avoid circular dependencies
- Used lazy loading for store access

### 3. Webpack Configuration Updates
Added deterministic module ordering:
```javascript
config.optimization = {
  ...config.optimization,
  moduleIds: 'deterministic',
  chunkIds: 'deterministic',
};
```

## Result
- Version incremented to v2.42
- Successfully deployed to Firebase Hosting
- The circular dependency issue has been resolved
- Module ordering is now deterministic

## Key Takeaways
1. Avoid circular dependencies between store modules
2. Use lazy loading (require) when accessing stores from services
3. Be careful with destructured imports from React in bundled environments
4. Ensure proper module ordering in webpack configuration
