## üí° **Key Insights**

1. **The foundation is exceptional** - Almost all major systems are built and working
2. **Integration is the primary gap** - Features exist but aren't connected to main workflows  
3. **User discovery is poor** - Advanced features are buried and hard to find
4. **Mobile experience needs attention** - Some admin features not mobile-optimized
5. **Testing infrastructure is good** - Comprehensive test coverage exists

**Bottom Line**: This is a polish and integration sprint, not a feature development sprint. The goal is to surface and connect the incredible work already completed.
