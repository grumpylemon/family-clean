# Login Loop Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
The app was experiencing an infinite login loop where:
1. `signInWithGoogle` was being called repeatedly
2. "Checking for family with ID" logs were repeating
3. The dashboard showed "Loading..." indefinitely

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Console.log statements in useAuthZustand hook
The hook had console.log statements directly in the hook body that were triggering re-renders on every call.

### 2. Unstable function references
The fallback functions for `signInWithGoogle` and `signInAsGuest` were being recreated on every render.

### 3. Family fetching without guards
The `fetchFamily` function didn't check if it was already loading or if the family was already loaded.

### 4. Dashboard useEffect dependency issue
The dashboard was watching the entire `family` object in useEffect, causing re-renders when any property changed.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useAuthZustand hook (hooks/useAuthZustand.ts)
- Moved console.log statements into a useEffect to prevent them from running on every render
- Removed the function creation in fallback functions, using direct store access instead
- This prevents infinite re-renders caused by logging

### 2. Added guards to fetchFamily (stores/familySlice.ts)
- Added check to prevent duplicate fetches while loading
- Added check to skip fetch if family is already loaded
- This prevents the "Checking for family with ID" loop

### 3. Fixed dashboard useEffect dependency (app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx)
- Changed dependency from `[family]` to `[family?.id]`
- This prevents re-renders when family object properties change but ID stays the same

## Verification Steps
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Sign in with Google
3. Verify that:
   - No repeated console logs appear
   - Dashboard loads successfully
   - Family data is fetched only once

## Technical Details

The issue was a classic React infinite loop caused by:
- Side effects in render functions (console.log)
- Unstable object/function references
- Missing loading state guards
- Overly broad useEffect dependencies

The fixes ensure that:
- Functions are stable across renders
- API calls are properly guarded
- Dependencies are as specific as possible
- Side effects are properly contained in useEffect hooks
