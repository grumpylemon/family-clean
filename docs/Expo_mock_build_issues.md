Issues Fixed:

  1. Mock Auth State Conflicts - The AuthContext and Firebase mock were both trying to
  manage user state, causing race conditions and the "stuck on welcome page" issue.

  2. Poor Mock Firestore - The mock database operations were too basic and didn't actually
   store/retrieve data, causing "Unable to load family data" errors.

  3. Broken Sign Out - The mock auth's sign out wasn't properly clearing state or
  notifying listeners.

  4. Family Data Issues - The "already in family" errors occurred because mock operations
  weren't properly integrated.

  Key Changes Made:

  - Enhanced mock Firebase with proper in-memory storage and state management
  - Fixed AuthContext to avoid conflicting user initialization
  - Improved Firestore service to use mock database for user/family data
  - Added better error handling and loading states for iOS
  - Created automatic mock data setup with a test family and user profile

  The app should now properly:
  - ✅ Load without getting stuck on the welcome page
  - ✅ Handle sign in/out correctly in iOS mock mode
  - ✅ Load family data without errors
  - ✅ Allow proper navigation between screens
  - ✅ Show helpful error recovery options
