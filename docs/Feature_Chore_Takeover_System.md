# Chore Takeover System - Feature Deep Dive

## 1.1 Feature Goal

The Chore Takeover System empowers family members to proactively take over uncompleted chores from other members, promoting family collaboration and ensuring important tasks get done. This feature provides:

- **User-visible value**: Family members can claim overdue or abandoned chores, earning bonus points/XP while helping the family
- **Reduced friction**: No more waiting for assigned members to complete overdue tasks
- **Increased engagement**: Gamified takeover mechanics with cooldowns and bonus rewards
- **Family harmony**: Prevents chore bottlenecks and reduces family tension over incomplete tasks

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### Core Rules
1. **Eligibility**: A chore becomes available for takeover when:
   - It's overdue by 24+ hours
   - Original assignee hasn't completed it
   - Chore isn't locked (lockedUntil has passed)

2. **Permission Checks**:
   - User must be an active family member
   - User cannot take over their own chores
   - User must have permission to complete chores (not excluded)
   - Admin approval required for high-value chores (100+ points)

3. **Cooldowns**:
   - User can only take over 2 chores per 24-hour period
   - After takeover, original assignee gets 48-hour cooldown on that chore
   - Completed takeover chores have 72-hour lock before reassignment

4. **Bonus System**:
   - Base points + 25% takeover bonus
   - Double XP for takeover completions
   - Special "Helper Hero" achievement for 10 takeovers
   - Streak bonus preserved if completing within 24 hours

### Edge Cases
- Recurring chores: Only current instance can be taken over
- Multiple takeover requests: First-come, first-served with optimistic locking
- Network failures: Queue takeover requests offline, validate on sync
- Partial completions: Original assignee loses partial credit on takeover

2. **Competition**: Leaderboard shows "Most Helpful" based on takeovers
3. **Achievements**: New badges for takeover milestones
4. **Visual Feedback**: Special animation for takeover completions

### Reduced Friction

2. **Smart notifications**: Alert when chores become takeover-eligible

4. **Clear status**: Visual indicators for takeover-eligible chores

### Family Dynamics

3. **Fairness**: Prevents gaming with cooldowns and limits
4. **Transparency**: Full takeover history visible to family
