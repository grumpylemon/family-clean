# Advanced Admin Controls - Feature Deep Dive

## 1.1 Feature Goal

The Advanced Admin Controls provide comprehensive family management tools for takeover system administration:

### User-visible Value:
- **Bulk Operations**: Approve/deny multiple takeover requests at once
- **Custom Rules**: Set takeover rules per chore type and family member
- **Export Capabilities**: Download family performance reports and takeover history
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard of pending approvals and system health
- **Granular Control**: Fine-tune takeover settings for optimal family dynamics

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### Admin Control Features
1. **Bulk Approval Interface**:
   - Display all pending high-value takeover requests
   - Multi-select with approve/deny actions
   - Reason tracking for admin decisions
   - Auto-notification to affected users

2. **Custom Takeover Rules**:
   - Per-chore-type takeover settings (kitchen vs outdoor)
   - Member-specific limits and bonuses
   - Time-based rules (weekend vs weekday)
   - Emergency override capabilities

3. **Performance Export System**:
   - Weekly/monthly family collaboration reports
   - Individual member performance summaries
   - Takeover trend analysis with charts
   - CSV/PDF export options

4. **Advanced Settings Panel**:
   - Global takeover system toggle
   - Smart notification scheduling
   - Automatic rule adjustments based on patterns
   - Family timezone and preference management

### Permission & Validation Rules
- Only family admins can access advanced controls
- Changes require confirmation for destructive actions
- Audit trail for all admin modifications
- Rollback capability for recent changes

### Edge Cases
- Multiple admins editing simultaneously
- Invalid rule combinations (conflicting settings)
- Export timeouts for large datasets
- Member removal while pending approvals exist

## 1.3 Ripple Map

### New Files to Create
1. **Admin Components** (`components/admin/`):
   - `TakeoverApprovalQueue.tsx` - Bulk approval interface
   - `CustomRulesManager.tsx` - Rule configuration UI
   - `PerformanceExportPanel.tsx` - Export functionality
   - `AdvancedSettingsPanel.tsx` - System settings
   - `AuditLogViewer.tsx` - Change history

2. **Services** (`services/`):
   - `adminControlsService.ts` - Admin operations
   - `exportService.ts` - Report generation
   - `auditService.ts` - Change tracking

3. **Hooks** (`hooks/`):
   - `useAdminControls.ts` - Admin state management
   - `useExportData.ts` - Export functionality

### Files to Modify
1. **Admin Screen** (`app/(tabs)/admin.tsx`):
   - Add advanced controls section
   - New admin tool cards

2. **Types** (`types/index.ts`):
   - Add admin control interfaces
   - Export configuration types

3. **Family Store** (`stores/familyStore.ts`):
   - Add admin control state
   - Custom rules management

### Database Schema Changes
```json
// families/{familyId}/admin_settings
{
  "customRules": {
    "byChoreType": {
      "kitchen": {
        "takeoverThresholdHours": 12,
        "bonusMultiplier": 1.5,
        "maxDailyTakeovers": 3
      }
    },
    "byMember": {
      "user_123": {
        "takeoverLimit": 5,
        "bonusMultiplier": 0.8
      }
    }
  },
  "exportSettings": {
    "autoGenerate": true,
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "recipients": ["admin@family.com"]
  }
}

// admin_actions/{actionId}
{
  "adminId": "user_123",
  "action": "bulk_approval",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-29T16:00:00Z",
  "details": {
    "approvedCount": 5,
    "deniedCount": 2,
    "reason": "Weekend takeover batch"
  }
}
```

## 1.4 UX & Engagement Uplift

### Admin Efficiency
1. **Reduced Management Time**:
   - Bulk operations save 80% of approval time
   - Smart defaults reduce configuration overhead
   - Automated reports eliminate manual tracking

2. **Better Family Insights**:
   - Performance trends identify engagement patterns
   - Custom rules optimize for family dynamics
   - Export data enables external analysis

3. **Proactive Management**:
   - Early warning system for system abuse
   - Automatic adjustment suggestions
   - Real-time family health monitoring

### Family Experience
1. **Faster Approvals**: 
   - Bulk processing reduces wait times
   - Smart routing to available admins
   - Clear status updates for requests

2. **Fairer Rules**:
   - Custom settings accommodate individual needs
   - Transparent rule changes with notifications
   - Member-specific optimization

## 1.5 Data Model Deltas

### New TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
// Admin control interfaces
interface CustomTakeoverRules {
  byChoreType: Record<ChoreType, ChoreTypeRules>;
  byMember: Record<string, MemberRules>;
  timeBasedRules: TimeBasedRule[];
  emergencyOverrides: EmergencyOverride[];
}

interface ChoreTypeRules {
  takeoverThresholdHours: number;
  bonusMultiplier: number;
  maxDailyTakeovers: number;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  allowedDays: number[]; // 0-6 for Sun-Sat
}

interface MemberRules {
  takeoverLimit: number;
  bonusMultiplier: number;
  cooldownMultiplier: number;
  canSkipApproval: boolean;
  restrictedChoreTypes: ChoreType[];
}

interface TimeBasedRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  timeRange: {
    start: string; // "HH:MM"
    end: string;
  };
  daysOfWeek: number[];
  modifications: Partial<TakeoverSettings>;
  priority: number;
}

interface BulkApprovalRequest {
  takeoverIds: string[];
  action: 'approve' | 'deny';
  reason?: string;
  applyToFuture?: boolean; // Apply decision to similar requests
}

interface PerformanceReport {
  familyId: string;
  period: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };
  generatedAt: string;
  summary: {
    totalTakeovers: number;
    uniqueHelpers: number;
    averageResponseTime: number;
    collaborationScore: number;
  };
  memberStats: MemberPerformanceStats[];
  choreStats: ChorePerformanceStats[];
  trends: TrendData[];
}

interface AdminAction {
  id: string;
  adminId: string;
  adminName: string;
  familyId: string;
  action: 'bulk_approval' | 'rule_change' | 'settings_update' | 'export_generate';
  timestamp: string;
