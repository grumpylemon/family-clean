# Comprehensive Chore Rotation Management System - Integration Plan

## 1.0 The Goal

Transform the existing basic `handleChoreRotation()` function into a sophisticated, intelligent chore rotation system with comprehensive admin controls, multiple rotation strategies, calendar-aware scheduling, and advanced fairness algorithms. This integration will elevate Family Compass from a simple rotation tracker to an intelligent family workload distribution system.

- **Calendar-Aware Rotation**: Consider member availability and schedule conflicts
- **Random Rotation**: Fair randomization with anti-clustering algorithms
- **Preference-Based Rotation**: Honor member preferences and dislikes
- **Mixed Strategy**: Combine multiple strategies with configurable weights

### 1.1.2 Intelligent Fairness Engine
- **Dynamic Workload Calculation**: Real-time tracking of point distribution and time commitment

- **Buffer Time Management**: Smart spacing between similar chores

### 1.1.4 Comprehensive Admin Controls
- **Rotation Strategy Configuration**: Full control over rotation algorithms and weights
- **Member-Specific Settings**: Individual capacity limits, preferences, and restrictions
- **Chore Category Rules**: Different rotation rules for different chore types
- **Emergency Override System**: Manual rotation controls for special circumstances

- **Gradual Introduction**: Smart ramp-up for new members or after long absences
- **Probation Handling**: Modified rotation logic for members on probation
- **Capacity Management**: Automatic workload adjustment based on member capabilities
- **Preference Learning**: AI-powered learning of member preferences over time

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### 1.2.1 Core Rotation Engine Rules
1. **Primary Eligibility Check**: Member must be active, not excluded, and within capacity limits
2. **Availability Validation**: Check calendar conflicts and pre-existing commitments
3. **Skill Requirements**: Verify member has required certifications for chore
4. **Fairness Scoring**: Calculate fairness score based on current workload distribution
5. **Strategy Application**: Apply selected rotation strategy (round-robin, workload-based, etc.)
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle edge cases where no eligible members exist
7. **Assignment Execution**: Atomic update of chore assignment and rotation state
8. **Notification Dispatch**: Notify affected members of new assignments

### 1.2.2 Workload Balancing Algorithm
1. **Current Load Calculation**: Sum of assigned points, time estimates, and difficulty scores
2. **Historical Performance**: Factor in completion rates and average completion times
3. **Capacity Scoring**: Calculate remaining capacity based on member limits
4. **Preference Weighting**: Apply preference multipliers to workload calculations
5. **Equity Adjustment**: Add penalty scores for members who are behind in fair share
6. **Final Score Calculation**: Combine all factors into single assignability score

### 1.2.3 Calendar Integration Logic
1. **Availability Window**: Define time windows when chore could be completed
2. **Conflict Detection**: Check for calendar conflicts during availability windows
3. **Travel Time Calculation**: Factor in travel time between locations/commitments
4. **Energy Level Estimation**: Consider time of day and member energy patterns
5. **Buffer Time Application**: Ensure adequate spacing between commitments
6. **Alternative Time Suggestion**: Propose optimal alternative times if conflicts exist

### 1.2.4 Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **No Eligible Members**: Chore remains unassigned with notification to admins
- **All Members at Capacity**: Queue chore for next availability window
- **Certification Required**: Notify admins if no certified members available
- **Calendar API Failure**: Graceful fallback to basic availability checking
- **Takeover Conflicts**: Priority resolution when multiple takeover requests exist
- **Rotation Index Corruption**: Auto-repair rotation order and indices

### 1.2.5 Cooldown & Timing Rules
- **Standard Cooldown**: Configurable per-chore cooldown periods
- **Dynamic Cooldown**: Adjust cooldown based on completion quality and speed
- **Member-Specific Cooldown**: Different cooldown rules per member type
- **Seasonal Cooldown**: Automatic adjustment for seasonal chores
- **Emergency Override**: Admin ability to bypass cooldowns when necessary
- **Cooldown Stacking**: Prevent multiple cooldown assignments to same member

### 1.2.6 Permission & Access Control
- **Admin Full Control**: Complete access to all rotation settings and overrides
- **Manager Partial Control**: Access to rotation strategy selection and basic settings
- **Member View Access**: Read-only access to rotation schedules and fairness metrics
- **Emergency Permissions**: Temporary elevation for urgent rotation needs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all rotation decisions and manual overrides
