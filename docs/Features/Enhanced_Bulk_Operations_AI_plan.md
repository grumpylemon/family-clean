# Enhanced Bulk Operations with AI Integration - Technical Plan

## 1.0 The Goal

Transform the existing bulk operations framework into an **intelligent multi-chore management system** powered by Google Gemini AI that can understand natural language requests, suggest optimal modifications, and execute complex multi-step operations on household chores. This integration builds upon the established Template Library foundation to provide families with sophisticated yet intuitive bulk management capabilities that leverage AI to make complex chore operations as simple as conversational requests.

The goal is to eliminate the friction of managing multiple chores simultaneously while introducing AI-powered insights that help families optimize their household management through intelligent suggestions, conflict detection, and automated optimizations.

- **Collaborative Approval Workflow**: Allows family input on significant bulk changes before execution
- **User Value**: Ensures bulk operations enhance rather than disrupt family harmony

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### **1.2.1 AI Integration Rules**
- **Gemini API Authentication**: Secure API key management with environment variable configuration
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 AI requests per minute per family to prevent abuse
- **Content Filtering**: All AI requests filtered for appropriate family content only
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive family data stored in AI service, only chore metadata sent for analysis
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: All AI features degrade gracefully to manual operation if API unavailable

### **1.2.2 Natural Language Processing Rules**
- **Supported Commands**: 
  - Assignment: "assign all kitchen chores to Sarah", "give all easy chores to kids"
  - Scheduling: "move all chores to weekend", "reschedule overdue chores to tomorrow"
  - Modification: "increase points for all hard chores by 50%", "make all bathroom chores worth 15 points"
  - Combinations: "assign all morning chores to adults and afternoon chores to teens"
- **Command Validation**: AI-parsed commands validated against family member list and chore constraints
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: System asks for clarification when AI parsing results in multiple interpretations
- **Command History**: Track successful commands to improve parsing accuracy over time

### **1.2.3 Bulk Operation Permission Rules**
- **Admin-Only Operations**: Delete multiple chores, assign chores to other family members
- **Member Self-Operations**: Modify own assigned chores only (points adjustment limited to ±20%)
- **Family Impact Threshold**: Operations affecting >50% of family's active chores require admin approval
- **High-Value Protection**: Bulk modifications to chores >50 points require explicit confirmation
- **Template Override Protection**: Bulk operations cannot modify template-generated chores beyond defined parameters

### **1.2.4 AI Suggestion Generation Rules**
- **Context Analysis**: AI considers family size, member ages, current workload distribution, completion patterns
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Suggestions adapt to current season and upcoming holidays/events
- **Workload Balancing**: AI ensures bulk changes maintain equitable distribution (±15% variance maximum)
- **Difficulty Progression**: Suggestions respect member skill levels and avoid overwhelming assignments
- **Time Constraint Validation**: All AI suggestions validated against family schedule and member availability

### **1.2.5 Conflict Detection Rules**
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Detect overlapping time assignments for same family member
- **Workload Imbalances**: Flag bulk operations creating >30% workload disparity between members
- **Skill Mismatches**: Identify assignments of high-difficulty chores to inappropriate family members
- **Resource Conflicts**: Detect multiple chores requiring same space/equipment simultaneously
- **Family Event Conflicts**: Cross-reference against family calendar for scheduling conflicts

### **1.2.6 Operation Rollback Rules**
- **Rollback Window**: 24-hour window for undoing bulk operations without admin approval
- **Partial Rollback**: Allow selective undo of individual chores within bulk operation
- **Cascade Handling**: Rolling back operations that triggered subsequent changes requires admin approval
- **State Consistency**: Rollback operations maintain data integrity and family member notifications
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of bulk operations and rollbacks for family transparency
