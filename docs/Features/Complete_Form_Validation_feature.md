## 1.3 User Cases

### Primary Users:
1. **Family Admins**: Creating and managing chores, inviting members, setting up rewards
2. **Family Members**: Viewing validation feedback when interacting with forms
3. **New Users**: Getting guided feedback during initial family setup

### Use Case Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Admin Creating New Chore
1. Admin opens ChoreManagement modal
2. Starts typing chore title - sees real-time character count
3. Enters invalid point value (150) - sees error "Points must be between 1-100"
4. Adjusts to valid value (25) - sees green checkmark
5. Sets cooldown longer than frequency - sees cross-field error
6. Corrects values - form enables submit button
7. Successfully creates chore with validated data

#### Scenario 2: Member Invitation with Validation
1. Admin opens ManageMembers modal
2. Enters invalid email format - sees shake animation and error
3. Corrects email format - sees green validation
4. Tries to invite existing member - sees "Email already in family" error
5. Enters new valid email - successfully sends invitation

#### Scenario 3: Reward Creation with Smart Suggestions
1. Admin opens RewardManagement modal
2. Enters reward name - sees uniqueness validation
3. Sets very high point cost (800) - sees warning "This seems expensive for level 1 users"
4. Adjusts point cost or increases minimum level
5. Successfully creates balanced reward
