# New Architecture Compatibility Integration Plan

## 1.0 The Goal

Enable full compatibility with React Native's New Architecture in Expo SDK 53 by updating all dependencies, fixing codegen issues, and ensuring stable iOS builds. This integration will future-proof the application, improve performance through the new Fabric renderer and TurboModules, and restore the ability to deploy to the App Store with the latest SDK features.

## 1.1 Feature List

### 1.1.1 Updated Dependencies with New Architecture Support
- **User Value**: Improved app performance with faster rendering and reduced memory usage
- **Technical Value**: Access to latest React Native optimizations and features
- **Business Value**: Future-proof application that won't require emergency migrations

### 1.1.2 Fixed Codegen Compatibility
- **User Value**: Stable app experience without crashes or rendering issues
- **Technical Value**: Proper native module integration with type safety
- **Business Value**: Reduced maintenance burden and technical debt

### 1.1.3 Enhanced Build Pipeline
- **User Value**: More frequent updates and bug fixes
- **Technical Value**: Reliable automated builds with proper error handling
- **Business Value**: Faster time-to-market for new features

### 1.1.4 Improved Error Handling for Native Modules
- **User Value**: Better app stability and fewer crashes
- **Technical Value**: Easier debugging and issue resolution
- **Business Value**: Higher app store ratings and user retention

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### Dependency Update Rules
1. **Version Compatibility Matrix**
   - react-native-safe-area-context must be >= 5.4.1
   - All dependencies must support React Native 0.79.2
   - Expo SDK 53 compatibility required
   - New Architecture support verified

2. **Codegen Processing Rules**
   - Native component specs must be properly formatted
   - TurboModule specs must follow new conventions
   - No manual patches that break codegen
   - Proper TypeScript definitions for native modules

3. **Build Process Rules**
   - Clean builds required after dependency updates
   - Cache invalidation between architecture changes
   - Proper cleanup of previous patch attempts
   - Validation before submission to EAS

### Edge Cases
1. **Mixed Architecture Support**
   - Some libraries may only partially support New Architecture
   - Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
   - Graceful degradation where necessary

2. **Platform-Specific Issues**
   - iOS and Android may have different compatibility levels
   - Web platform unaffected by New Architecture changes
   - Different patch strategies per platform if needed

3. **Development vs Production**
   - Development builds may behave differently
   - Expo Go limitations with New Architecture
   - Production optimizations may reveal new issues
