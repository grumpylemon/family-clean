## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### Instruction Management Rules
- Instructions must be age-appropriate with multiple complexity levels (Child 5-8, Teen 9-12, Adult 13+)
- Safety warnings highlighted for hazardous tasks (chemicals, tools, heights)
- Step-by-step progression with dependency checking
- Visual aid integration with image/video support
- Customizable instruction templates per family preferences

### Performance Rating System
- **Incomplete**: 0% completion, requires reassignment, no points awarded
- **Partial**: 30-70% completion, partial points (50%), notes required
- **Complete**: 80-95% completion, full points, standard rewards
- **Excellent**: 95-100% completion, bonus points (110%), achievement potential
- Quality ratings influence future assignment priority and certification progress

### Certification Logic
- Chores marked with required certification levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Users must complete training modules before assignment eligibility
- Certification expiry tracking with re-certification requirements
- Training status affects rotation eligibility and assignment frequency
- Emergency override capability for urgent tasks

### Educational Content Engine
- Age-based fact delivery system with content appropriateness filters
- Quote selection algorithm matching chore type, difficulty, and user mood
- "Did You Know" facts sourced from educational databases
- Learning module integration with completion rewards
- Content freshness rotation to maintain engagement

### User Preference Analytics
