# Rotation System Admin Panel Integration - Technical Plan

## 1.0 The Goal
Integrate the comprehensive chore rotation management system with a dedicated admin panel interface, enabling family administrators to configure, monitor, and fine-tune the 7 rotation strategies, fairness engine, and schedule intelligence features through an intuitive UI.

## 1.1 Feature List

### 1.1.1 Rotation Strategy Configuration Panel
**User Value**: Admins can easily switch between and configure the 7 rotation strategies (Round Robin, Workload Balance, Skill-Based, Calendar-Aware, Random Fair, Preference-Based, Mixed Strategy) without technical knowledge.

### 1.1.2 Fairness Engine Dashboard
**User Value**: Real-time visibility into family workload distribution, equity scores, and rebalancing recommendations with actionable insights.

### 1.1.3 Member Rotation Preferences Management
**User Value**: Centralized interface to configure each family member's chore preferences, skill certifications, and availability patterns.

### 1.1.4 Schedule Intelligence Controls
**User Value**: Configure calendar integration settings, conflict detection thresholds, and availability scoring weights.

### 1.1.5 Rotation Analytics & Insights
**User Value**: Historical rotation performance data, strategy effectiveness metrics, and family satisfaction tracking.

### 1.1.6 Advanced Configuration Options
**User Value**: Fine-tune rotation algorithms with weights, cooldowns, emergency overrides, and custom rules.

### 1.1.7 Quick Actions & Testing Tools
**User Value**: Test rotation outcomes, preview assignments, force rebalancing, and emergency rotation overrides.

## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### 1.2.1 Rotation Strategy Rules
- **Strategy Selection**: Only one primary strategy active at a time, except Mixed Strategy which combines multiple
- **Weight Validation**: All strategy weights must sum to 1.0 in Mixed Strategy mode
- **Fallback Logic**: If advanced rotation fails, system falls back to basic Round Robin
- **Strategy Cooldown**: 24-hour minimum between strategy changes to prevent gaming

### 1.2.2 Permission Checks
- **Admin Only**: All rotation configuration requires family admin role
- **Member View**: Regular members can view their own preferences but not family-wide settings
- **Emergency Override**: Admins can override any rotation assignment with justification
- **Audit Trail**: All configuration changes logged with timestamp and admin ID

### 1.2.3 Fairness Engine Rules
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Fairness scores below 75 trigger rebalancing warnings
- **Workload Variance**: Maximum 25% variance in workloads before intervention required
- **Capacity Limits**: No member can exceed 100% capacity utilization
- **Preference Respect**: Minimum 50% preference respect rate per member

### 1.2.4 Edge Cases
- **No Eligible Members**: Clear warning and manual assignment option
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Alternative time suggestions and override capabilities
- **Algorithm Failures**: Graceful degradation to simpler strategies
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Auto-repair mechanisms and admin notifications

### 1.2.5 Cooldowns & Timing
- **Strategy Changes**: 24-hour cooldown between modifications
- **Preference Updates**: Immediate effect with next rotation
- **Fairness Calculations**: Real-time updates with 5-minute debouncing
- **Analytics Refresh**: Daily automated reports, manual refresh available
