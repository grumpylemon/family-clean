## 1.2 Logic Breakdown

### **1.2.1 Smart Assignment Rules**
- **Member Availability Scoring**: 
  - Active hours based on historical completion patterns
  - Current week schedule conflicts from calendar integration
  - Declared availability preferences (morning person, evening person)
  - Recent completion rate (avoid overloading high performers)

- **Skill-Difficulty Matching**:
  - Member level vs chore difficulty ratings
  - Past completion success rate for similar chore types
  - Learning curve adjustments (gradual difficulty increase)
  - Age-appropriate task filtering

- **Workload Balancing Algorithm**:
  - Current point total assigned vs family average
  - Time-to-completion estimates based on historical data
  - Stress level indicators (high recent activity, missed deadlines)
  - Fair rotation enforcement with takeover adjustments

- **Edge Cases**:
  - All members unavailable → escalate to family notification
  - Member consistently declining assignments → admin notification
  - High-priority emergency chores → override normal assignment rules
  - New member onboarding → reduced initial load with mentorship assignments

### **1.2.2 Scheduling Logic**
- **Conflict Detection Rules**:
  - Calendar event overlap detection (30-minute buffer minimum)
  - Dependency chain validation (prerequisite chores must complete first)
  - Resource conflict detection (shared spaces, equipment)
  - Family event consideration (no chores during family time)

- **Rescheduling Rules**:
  - Missed chore automatic rescheduling within 24 hours
  - Weekend vs weekday preference handling
  - Time-sensitive chore prioritization (garbage day, meal prep)
  - Holiday and special event avoidance

- **Permission Checks**:
  - Only assigned member or family admin can reschedule
  - Emergency rescheduling allowed with automatic notification
  - Recurring chore pattern changes require admin approval
  - Calendar integration requires explicit member consent

### **1.2.3 Template System Rules**
- **Template Categories**:
  - Daily routines (morning prep, bedtime cleanup)
  - Weekly maintenance (deep cleaning, meal prep, yard work)
  - Seasonal tasks (spring cleaning, holiday preparation)
  - Event-based (birthday party prep, vacation cleanup)

- **Auto-Assignment Logic**:
  - Template application respects current family member roles
  - Point values auto-scale based on family size and member levels
  - Difficulty adjustments based on youngest participating member
  - Custom family modifications saved as family-specific template variants

### **1.2.4 Analytics Privacy & Data Rules**
- **Data Collection Boundaries**:
  - Only aggregate family patterns, no individual detailed tracking
  - Opt-in for predictive features and external benchmarking
  - Data retention policies (historical data archived after 1 year)
  - Export capabilities for family data ownership

### **1.2.5 Social Features Rules**
- **Challenge Eligibility**:
  - Minimum family size requirements for competitive challenges
  - Age-appropriate challenge filtering
  - Opt-out capabilities for members who prefer individual focus
  - Point/reward balancing to prevent gaming

## 2.0 Potential Errors

### **2.0.1 Smart Assignment System Errors**
- **ML Model Bias**: Algorithm may develop preferences for certain family members
  - Mitigation: Regular model auditing, fairness metrics, manual override capabilities
- **Availability Prediction Inaccuracy**: Calendar integration may miss schedule changes
  - Mitigation: Real-time sync, fallback to member confirmation, confidence scoring
- **Cold Start Problem**: New families lack historical data for accurate predictions
  - Mitigation: Default rule-based assignment, gradual ML adoption, template-based initialization

### **2.0.2 Calendar Integration Incompatibilities**
- **Permission Denial**: Users may deny calendar access affecting core functionality
  - Mitigation: Graceful degradation, manual scheduling options, clear value proposition
- **Calendar API Rate Limits**: High-frequency sync may hit external API limits
  - Mitigation: Intelligent sync scheduling, caching strategies, backup sync methods
- **Multi-Platform Sync Conflicts**: Different calendar providers may have conflicting data
  - Mitigation: Conflict resolution logic, user preference prioritization, manual override options

### **2.0.3 Template System Challenges**
- **Template Overwhelm**: Too many template options may confuse new users
  - Mitigation: Curated recommendations, progressive disclosure, guided selection wizard
- **Customization Complexity**: Template modifications may become too complex for average users
  - Mitigation: Simple customization defaults, preview capabilities, one-click revert options
- **Template Stagnation**: Families may become over-reliant on templates without growth
  - Mitigation: Personalization suggestions, template evolution recommendations, custom template encouragement

### **2.0.4 Analytics & Privacy Concerns**
- **Data Privacy Violations**: Extensive analytics collection may violate privacy expectations
  - Mitigation: Transparent data policies, granular privacy controls, regular audits
- **Performance Impact**: Heavy analytics processing may slow app performance
  - Mitigation: Background processing, data sampling, performance monitoring
- **Insight Overwhelm**: Too much analytical data may overwhelm rather than help families
  - Mitigation: Simplified dashboards, progressive disclosure, actionable focus

### **2.0.5 Social Features Risks**
- **Family Competition Toxicity**: Challenges may create unhealthy competition between family members
  - Mitigation: Positive competition design, opt-out capabilities, cooperation emphasis
- **Photo Privacy Issues**: Progress photos may contain sensitive family information
  - Mitigation: Photo approval workflows, automatic sensitive content detection, family-only visibility
- **Team Chore Coordination Failure**: Multi-member chores may suffer from coordination problems
  - Mitigation: Clear role definition, progress visibility, fallback individual assignment

### **2.0.6 Technical Infrastructure Risks**
- **ML Model Drift**: Assignment accuracy may degrade over time without proper monitoring
  - Mitigation: Continuous model monitoring, automatic retraining, performance alerts
- **Database Performance**: Complex analytics queries may impact real-time app performance
  - Mitigation: Query optimization, caching strategies, separate analytics infrastructure
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple new systems may create cascading failure risks
  - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, feature flags, comprehensive testing, rollback capabilities
