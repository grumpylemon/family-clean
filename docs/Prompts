## 1 Deep Thinking & Impact Analysis (⟨no code yet⟩)

Produce a **concise deep-dive documement.md with the filename of the integration headline inside @docs** covering:

- **1.1 Feature goal** Explain the user-visible value of “Chore Takeover System.”  
- **1.2 Logic breakdown** List every rule, edge-case, cooldown, permission check.  
- **1.3 Ripple map** Enumerate all files, modules, Cloud Functions, UI flows, and tests that will need changes or new additions—be exhaustive.  
- **1.4 UX & Engagement uplift** Describe how this feature will make the app stronger, more intuitive, and more engaging (gamification hooks, reduced friction, etc.).  
- **1.5 Data-model deltas** Show updated Firestore shapes (JSON) and TypeScript interfaces.  
- **1.6 Acceptance checklist** Bullet the conditions that must be true for us to call the feature “done.”

## 2 Implementation / Coding

Follow this disciplined cycle **for each logical chunk** (commit):

1. **Plan snippet** (1–2 lines)  
2. **Code diff** (new/updated files)  
3. **Immediate unit tests** (Jest)  
4. **Run static checks**  

## 3 Document Updates
1. Append a dated changelog entry under “Integrated Features” in @docs/development_task_list.md
2. Also update any affected ADRs, README snippets, or API docs

## REcommend next steps
1.Based on the updated dev doc, propose 2-3 incremental improvements or follow-up tickets—prioritised by user impact, technical risk, or debt reduction.
