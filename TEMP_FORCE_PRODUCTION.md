# Temporary Override for iOS Production Testing

If the environment variables are still not working correctly, add this temporary override to `config/firebase.ts` at line 295:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY OVERRIDE - FORCE PRODUCTION MODE FOR iOS
console.log('ðŸŽ¯ FINAL DECISION: _isUsingMock =', _isUsingMock);

// NUCLEAR OPTION: Uncomment the next 4 lines if still in mock mode on iOS production
// if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
//   console.log('ðŸš¨ NUCLEAR: Forcing production mode for iOS');
//   _isUsingMock = false;
// }
```

This will force real Firebase authentication and should:
1. Show Google login screen instead of auto-signing in
2. Allow you to sign in with your Google account
3. Connect to the real Firebase database to find family QJ7FEP

**After fixing**: Remove this override and figure out why environment variables aren't working.
